        <h3> YOUNGEST PLAYER TO SCORE A HALF CENTURY IN ODI CRICKET</h3>
        <p><strong>Record Holder:</strong> Kushal Malla</p>
        <p>ushal Malla from Nepal is the youngest player to score half-century in ODI. Malla was only 15 years old when he got his first half century.

            Kushal Malla from Nepal is a hard hitting batsman who is well known for his both batting and bowling ability. The young talent is a left handed batsman and a left arm spinner.
            
           <br> On February 8, 2020 , Nepal was playing a game against U.S.A in ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2. After winning the toss , USA chose to bowl first in  Kritipur.The bowlers from USA were in quite a form as they managed to send half of the players back to pavilion in just 49 runs. The home fans were stunned by the performance of USA. And then came Nepal’s youngest team member who was just 15 years old at that time.

            In that inning , Kushal decided to play his natural game. Young Malla scored half century in just 49 balls. He managed to hit 4 boundaries and 3 sixes in that game. Due to his impressive batting ability Team Nepal managed to score 190 runs in first inning.

    <div class="record">
        <h3>Joint world record of bowling out a team in just 35 runs in ODI International</h3>
        <p><strong>Record Holder:</strong> nNepali cricket team</p>
        <p>On February 12 2020 , Nepal were playing a game against USA in ICC World Cup League Division 2. Before that game USA were looking solid in the tournament as they had won 6 games out of 9 games they played.
            ven after being in a hot form , USA had no answers for the questions asked by the Nepali spinners. The international superstar Sandeep Lamichhane managed to bag 6 wickets for just 16 runs where as Sushan Bhari , another talented spinner , managed to take 4 wickets of USA.

        <br> Only opening batter Xavier Marshall managed to score in double digits in that game. Other batters of USA didn’t even manage to cross 5 runs from their bat.
        This feat in the world of cricket was only achieved once before in international cricket. It was the time when Zimbabwe had managed to score 35 runs against Srilanka in 2004. Thus , Nepal and Sri Lanka holds a joint world record of bowling out a team in lowest possible score.
